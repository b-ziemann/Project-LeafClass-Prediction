## Project-LeafClass-Prediction
In jupyter notebook using Python3 for predicting classes of leaves based off machine learning technique kNN(K nearest neighbor). I use numpy and scikit-learn to better explain and solve prediction.

## Technique:
Using maching leaning kNN to predict classes of Leaves from variables in the dataset
